Fake News Detection with NLP and Logistic Regression
📌 Project Overview

This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a Logistic Regression model to classify news articles as real or fake. With the massive spread of misinformation online, automated fake news detection is becoming a crucial tool for digital literacy and social trust.

⚙️ Features

Preprocessing of raw news text (stopword removal, tokenization, stemming/lemmatization).
Feature extraction using TF-IDF Vectorization.
Implementation of Logistic Regression for binary classification.
Performance evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Clear and reproducible workflow in Jupyter Notebook.

📂 Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains labeled news articles tagged as fake or real.
